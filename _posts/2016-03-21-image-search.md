## Free?

There are several sites which offer free images.
I've wasted a lot of time trolling through them.

* [http://fabian-kostadinov.github.io](http://fabian-kostadinov.github.io)

Most of these sites have banner ads that entice you to paid image sites.

My strategy is to start with free sites.
And when I get gisgusted with how crappy they are, 
at a certain point, realize my time is worth more,
and get satisfaction at paid sites.


## Paid sites

Among the largest and most heavily marketed:

* [Getty Images](http://gettyimages.com)


A big reason for images from paid sites is the crisper look from higher resolution images.

Prefer lossless png files over jpg files which loses resolution with each edit.


## Search terms

I think one of the keys to finding stuff is using keywords like a boss.

[maps.google.com](http://maps.google.com)
is your friend.

Here are some tips:

* Begin with the size image you want, such as "1900x500".
  This will save you from needing to crop.

   Once you've exhausted those:

* Filter your search term by adding a word with a dash in front, 
   such as "-1900x500" if that's what you DON'T want anymore.

* Add **-icon** to filter out the type of image.

So that's that basic pattern: build up your keywords in the search bar.
Try a keyword, then filter.

## Keywords

Here's a list for your brainstorming pleasure:

* Color: white, green, etc.

* Type of image: panorama, HD, movie, etc.

* Type of file: jpg, png, svg, mp4, etc.

* Season of the year.

* Emotion: happy, sad, mad, angry, etc.

* Tone: speed

* Location: forest, desert

* Country: USA


## What I'd rather not

Avoid an image with words in it, in case you have to localize your site.


## Eureka - now save it

If you see an image that you like, save it for later so you can move on.

Here are some tips about saving the image.

0. Alt-click on the image to save it.

If you don't see **Save Image as...**,
   alt-click again and select **Inspect element**.

0. You may need to save the expand the HTML coding by clicking the arrow in front of a line.

0. If the img src= doesn't beging with "http", you'll need to construct a url.

   Copy the href contents between the quotes, such as:

/static/v1.5.0/core/img/header/doubleclick-search.jpg

   Begin with just the host name in the URL on the browser. 

   Clear out characters after the last slash.

* The size of images is important. A 512x512 image

SVG images cannot be saved that way.
Yet they are the preferred type of image file because they scale well, 
meaning they look crisp at different sizes.


## Save credit information with images

OK, the likelihood of you getting sued over a picture is small.

But you'll sleep better at night knowing that you're not being hunted.

So save your worry for other things by doing the right thing.

One way to do it is creating a text file named the same as the image,
but with a .txt extension.
In the file

   * URL where you got the information,
   * The date when you retrived it
   * From URL where you found it (such as google)

I personally have a website called assets that I use to save my images.

   I tag each image so I can find them later.
