### Peripherals

The squarish holes are <strong>thunderbolt</strong> ports,
which connect devices such as hard drives, monitors, etc.
Apple sells adapters for connecting to DVI, HDMI, and VGA monitors as well as LN45 Ethernet.
The MiniDisplay Port is compatible only with Display Port compatible devices, 
such as an external monitor. 

There are 2 squarish miniports so they can chain up to 10 thunderbolt devices.
A display that isn't compatible with Thunderbolt must be the last one in the chain.

Thunderbolt can transfer at speeds up to 20Gbps. 
Higher speeds than USB.

#### USB drives

To watch Bluray disks, get a Samsung external drive.

Apple's DVD drives don't play Bluray.

#### USB-C ports

2015 Macbooks 
don't come with regular USB ports so one has to buy 
<a target="_blank" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MJ1M2AM/A/usb-c-to-usb-adapter">
$19 Apple proprietary adapter cables</a>.

Another power plug runs 
<a target="_blank" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MJ262LL/A/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter?fnode=51">
$49</a>

2015 Macbooks combine power and communication (Ethernet) into a single
proprietary oblong rounded USB-C connector.
USB-C connectors can be inserted on either side (unlike earlier USB plugs).
It follows the USB 3.1 standard, which has a theoretical
maximum speed of up to 10Gbps (gigabits per second)
-- two times faster than USB 3.0. But the Macbook is at 5Gbps for now.

3.1 support is used by <a target="_blank" href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/MJ1K2AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter"> Apple's $79 HDMI/VGA connector</a>
and by upcoming MHL (Mobile High-definition Link) 3 devices to 
stream 4K video from mobile devices to TV sets.

Get a USB-C to USB-B cable.
Plug it into a battery pack and you can charge the laptop.

### Cooling

The Macbook Pro has always had a history of running hot. 

if you're only using power when plugging into the Mac's USB hub connector,
use an external USB power plug straight into the wall outlet.

### Wrist Rest Cushion

I like some cushioning for where my palm
touches the cold hard keyboard and 
on sharp edges of the Mac Pro Retina laptop.

In https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203671
Apple recommends against use of palm pads.

Unlike the much better looking leather
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.twelvesouth.com/product/surfacepad-for-macbook"> $29 TwelveSouth</a>,
the <a target="_blank" href="
http://www.amazon.com/GRIFITI-Notebook-Silicone-Reposition-Travelling/dp/B00897D3OQ/ref=wilsonslifenotes">
$9.99 GRIFITI Palm Pads</a>
is removeable (rests on rather than glued on the keyboard), so
it can be taken off before closing the cover.


## Case

Dropping a Macbook can crack the screen.

But it adds to the weight.
