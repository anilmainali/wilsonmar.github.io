## The columns

* <strong>#</strong> contains counts of the deliverable.

* **Deliverables** short description

* **Urgency**: Number 1 is highest. You may want to use A,B,C,D instead here.

  This column is not used in any calculation.

* **Effort**: Number for estimating, taken from Agile practitioners.

  This number may mean different things to different people.

  The coloring was set by highlighting the column and clicking Word's **Conditional Formatting** icon
  on the Home ribbon or menu Format.

* **%**: auto-calculated by an Excel formula.

  CAUTION: Typing in this column destroys the calculation.

* **Days**: The number of man-days. The number in each row is a fraction of the
  total under the same column within the **Totals** tab.
  A separate tab is used so the Assets sheet can be sorted easier.

  Calculations are based on the percentage of Effort.

  CAUTION: Typing in this column destroys the calculation.

* **Yield**: is for comment about the outcome (FTW).

* **Note**:

## Usage

This spreadsheet helps you realize when you're over-extended with commitments.

Review the man-days to see if it's reasonable,

The number of days at the bottom should be **work-days** (about 20 a month),
less holidays, vacations, and
a margin for various more urgent items that
come up to eat up time along the way.

(> It's better to under-commit and over-deliver than<br />over-commit and under-deliver.)

You can sort this spreadsheet by various columns.
