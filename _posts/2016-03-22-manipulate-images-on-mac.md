## Sketch

I have adopted Sketch on my Mac.

The theme that I am using makes use of 1900x500 photos.

Here's how I've learned to make images of that size.

## Search

The easiest thing is to avoid cropping altogether by finding

Search in images.google.com for "1900x500".

## Crop

1. Open the image file.

0. Click the **Scale** button and specify one of the dimensions (Width 1900 or Height 500, not both).

   Create a mask area:

0. Click the **Insert** icon at the upper-left corner.

0. Select Shape | Rectangle.

0. On the screen drag a small rectangle. Don't worry about the size because it's too difficult to come up
   up with a precise box with the mouse.

0. On the Size: type in 1900 and 500.'

0. Drag the mask area onto the picture.

0. At the left, select both the Rectangle and the picture: hold down the shift key and click.

0. Click the **Mask** icon.

0. Click menu File | Export. Select Export Selection.

0. Select the Format (JPG) at the lower right.

0. Click Export Slice 1.

0. Specify the file name and folder name.

0. Copy the file name to the clipboard so you put a reference to it somewhere.
