Public beta releases 
are often the first time that partners and friends have 
substantial hands-on experience with the upcoming version.

I think too many developers waste the opportunity
to build goodwill and additional assistance that beta participants can provide.

Here is a summary of my advice explained further below:

0. <a href="#Define"> Define actors and use cases</a>.
0. <a href="#Automate"> Automate use case flows by each actor</a>.
0. <a href="#Capture"> Capture detailed factual proof points</a>.
0. <a href="#Detail"> Detail history of run speeds</a>.
0. <a href="#Help"> Help those who participate</a>.
0. <a href="#Delegate"> Delegate socialization of specifics</a>.
0. <a href="#Track"> Make it easy to track progress and get reports</a>.

More about each is described below.

<a name="Define"></a>

### Define actors and use cases

   Too many organizations release only the software and
   expect everyone to somehow just figure it all out on their own.

   This results in not enough coverage simply because people don't
   know about all the features.

   Clarification of who is being served by the product
   and what each type of user does 
   would provide a richer basis for suggestions.

<a name="Automate"></a>

### Automate use case flows by each actor

   Automation of keystrokes are useful not just for testing.

   Ideally, automation activities should start 

   Being able to run the demo sequence automatically would provide 
   <strong>salespeople and others confidence</strong> 
   that their live demo actually works
   rather than having to say sorry.

   Having automated use-case runs also helps to speed the development of
   <strong>product vidoes</strong> needed for not just launch but
   throughout the product lifecycle.

   The more people who views a video, 
   the more varied the extent of feedback.

<a name="Capture"></a>

### Capture detailed factual proof points

   General platitudes like "oh it's great" does a marketer no good.

   Marketers need specific and relatable "sound bites" 
   and quotes that can be published. An example:

   "It now takes me 2 minutes to do what used to take 30 minutes.
   Love the automatic features of this new release."

   So we want to encourage beta reviewers to 
   take measurements before, during, and after demo activities.

   Valid measurements require planning and discipline,
   and that takes pre-planning and encouragement before and 
   all the way through the process.

<a name="Detail"></a>

### Detail history of run speeds

   If timings of each action taken by the automated scripts are
   captured during each run, there would be data to diagnose
   complaints about a particular interaction being slow.

   If those timings are captured 
   at various points in various environments (including runs on developer laptops),
   troubleshooting can include comparison across different environments
   and under varying conditions over time.

   This also enables anomalies to be identified earlier.


<a name="Help"></a>

### Help those who participated

   Many consultants make hay from the fact that they had a hand in the creation of
   the product.

   So have a webpage that acknowledges their participation so they can point to 
   proof that they mattered.

   Some beta participants had to fight hard 
   to get approval for taking time to participate.

   So a letter or email to their bosses from one senior manager to another
   would go a long way to ensure continued enthusiam in the future.

   Such communication is an opportunity to "sell" the product,
   and contribute to continued willingness to pay maintenance fees.

   As importantly, help beta participants avoid the need to run through a gauntlet
   of inexperience people when technical support is needed.

<a name="Delegate"></a>

### Delegate socialization of specifics

   It takes a tremendous amount of time to stay in touch and clarify feedback.

   So consider "deputizing" select individuals ("ambassadors") 
   from among the user community to
   take responsibility for communicating personally with his/her peers
   about the demo.

   Ambassadors who live the product are in the best position to 
   integrate comments from various others into 
   single cohesive actionable statements.

   Communications can be emails or, better yet, regular phone calls and
   video conference calls.

   It helps if communication events are planned ahead,
   with several reminders ahead of each event,
   and follow-ups after.

   Direct and personal communications can help to smooth over inevitable gliches
   so disappointments do not turn into long-term bitterness.

<a name="Track"></a>

### Make it easy to track progress and get reports

   Provide a system for demo participants to track their 
   activities and communications.

   Make it easy by providing a special "bcc" address for 
   ambassadors when they send out emails.

   A system can then parse emails to collate the information,
   and present it in reports.

   Design the tracking and reports based on specific actors and use case
   flows so decisions and actions can be specifically actionable.
