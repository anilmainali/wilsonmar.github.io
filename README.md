I hope you'll file an issue or send a Pull Request. 

I need the help.

This repository is based on a theme by Michael Rose,
[Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes).
[His demo of the theme](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/)
includes a [minimal setup Guide](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/theme-setup/).

The Minimal Mistakes theme provides:

* Responsive templates. Looking good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
* Gracefully degrading in older browsers. Compatible with Internet Explorer 8+ and all modern browsers.
* Minimal embellishments -- content first.
* Optional large feature images for posts and pages.
* Simple and clear permalink structure.
* [Custom 404 page](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/404.html) to get you started.
* Support for Disqus Comments

Changes I've made:

* Add post files within the _posts folder.
* Change tab settings in the navigation_yml within the _data folder,
* Change folder names to reflect those changes.

* Fix social_share

* Change _config.yml at the root to add citrix: to take advantage of JavaScript added

* Add Microsoft Windows 10 icons
